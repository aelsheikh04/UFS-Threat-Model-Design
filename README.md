# University Financial System Threat Modeling

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive threat model for the University Financial System, incorporating a newly developed web-based portal for student financial services.
The system is designed to provide secure access for students to view balances, payment history, set up payment accounts, make one-time payments, and configure automatic payments.

The project employs advanced security measures to ensure data protection and user authentication while integrating seamlessly with the university's existing financial infrastructure.

## Features

- **Threat Modeling**: Utilized Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT) to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Detailed representation of data exchanges and trust boundaries.
- **VPN Spoofing Analysis**: Includes an attack tree to identify vulnerabilities and a defense tree to propose mitigations.
- **Comprehensive Report**: Documented findings, mitigations, and recommendations for further enhancements.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT)**: For generating the threat model and DFD.
- **Microsoft Visio**: For visual representation of attack and defense trees.
- **Documentation Tools**: For creating reports and project documentation.
